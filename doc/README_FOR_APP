Mail vs Message
---------------

A `Mail` is what is stored in the IMAP server. It has headers, and a UID, and belongs to the account (the recipient or perhaps the sender) whose mailbox contains it.

A `Message` is the the content (and most of the headers) of a `Mail` as identified uniquely by its `Message-ID` header. More than one `Mail` can have the same `Message-ID`, and those `Mail`s are all effectively partial instances of the same `Message`.

A `Message` is what the sender writes; each recipient has their own stored (and slightly differing) copy of the `Message`, and those stored copies are `Mail`s.
