# Use Ruby 1.9.2

This'll be handled by the .rvmrc file in this project if you're using RVM.  Otherwise, you're on your own.

# Install mongo 1.8 or 2

Homebrew will currently install version 2 but that appears to work OK.

    $ brew install mongo

# Create a gmail account

    $ script/rails c
    irb> GmailAccount.create! email: 'your-email', password: 'your-password'

# Download your emails

Unless you want to download all your messages, you'll want to edit GmailAccount#recent_uids so that it reads something like `@imap.fetch(indexes_excluding_most_recent, "UID").map { |x| x.attr["UID"] }.last(200)`.  *NOTE* The `.last(200)` to restrict the number of messages.

    $ script/download

# Import your emails

    $ script/update

# Start the server

*NOTE* The default username/password is 'username' and 'password'.  Configure them by setting the USERNAME and PASSWORD environment variables.

    $ script/rails s
    # or
    $ USERNAME='foo' PASSWORD='bar' script/rails s
